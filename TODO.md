## 🚀 To Do (Active)

### High Priority (Tonight)
- [x] Build Sats Earned Tracker (real-time, daily, weekly, all-time) ✅ DONE
- [x] Build Miner Health Dashboard with alerts ✅ DONE
- [x] Build Power Efficiency Matrix (W/TH tracking) ✅ DONE
- [x] Build Pool Performance Comparison ✅ DONE
- [x] Build Predictive Revenue Model ✅ DONE
- [x] Improve Telegram setup (validation, CLI helper) ✅ DONE

### Frontend Integration (Next Session)
- [ ] Create dashboard cards for Sats Earned Tracker

- [ ] Create Pool Comparison visualization
- [ ] Create Revenue Projector with target calculator
- [ ] Wire up Telegram setup endpoints to UI
- [ ] Add status indicators for bot/chat validation

### Existing Issues
- [ ] Do not let program increase or decrease frequency more than 25 in minutes
- [ ] Map out energy page way better / debug
- [ ] Rethink preset miner capabilities  
- [ ] Add "tuning" page to miner cards - if manually tuned, do not auto optimize
  - [ ] Have easy way to revert back to auto tuning
- [ ] Work on charts (add/remove any?)
